            "I'm a self-taught programmer with a unique background in Applied Geology. My journey into software engineering began while working on a GIS-based Satellite Image Processing project in my final year of M.Sc., driven by a passion for technology and problem-solving. Over the past 3+ years, I've honed my skills in a wide array of web technologies, specializing in modern JavaScript frameworks.",
            "My expertise spans frontend and backend development, including TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, and various databases and APIs. I've led the development of a production-level AI-powered chatbot platform and related client dashboard from the ground up. My geological roots give me a distinct problem-solving approach, allowing me to craft user-centric solutions that stand out in the digital landscape.",
            "When I'm not coding, you can find me enjoying hot coffee, music, long walks, or exploring new places. I'm always excited to take on new challenges and collaborate on innovative projects.
